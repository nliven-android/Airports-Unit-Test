Eclipse:
---------
1. Fork/download this project locally.  
   **NOTE** This project only has the JAR Dependencies you need to run unit tests!!  
   The test files themselves can be found in the 'test' folder in the Airports-App project itself.
   
2. Follow the instructions here on how to create the Java Project and 'link'
   to the test java files: 
   https://github.com/thecodepath/android_guides/wiki/Robolectric-Installation-for-Unit-Testing
   (To make things easier, you can create the 'Java Project' in Eclipse within the folder you created
    in Step #1 when you originally cloned it locally.)
